# Function Expressions

## Expression: A unit of code that results in a value

-   It doesn't have to save a variable

# By Reference

-   a = b , in relation to objects (not primitives)
-   Two names point to the same address

# By Value (primitives)

-   a = 3
-   a = b

-   "a" points to a location in memory that holds the value 3
-   that point in memory gets copied, and "b" points to that copy of what "a" points to

## <u>Mutate</u>: to change something

## <u>Immutable</u>: unchangeable

# Arguments

-   The parameters you pass to a function
-   JS gives you a keyword of the same name which contains them all

# Whitespace

-   Invisible characters that create literal 'space' in your written code
-   Carriage returns, tabs, spaces.

# Callback Function

-   A function you give to another function, to be run when the other function is finished.

-   So the function you call (i.e. invoke), 'calls back' by calling the function you gave it when it finishes.

# Function Currying

-   Creating a copy of a function but some preset parameters
-   Very useful in mathematical situations
