# Types

### Dynamic Typing:

-   You don't tell the engine what types of data a variable holds, it figures it out while your code is running.

-   Variables can hold different types of values because it's all figured out during execution.

<code>
var isNew = true; // no errors
isNew = 'yup!';
isNew = 1;
</code><br><br>

Static Typing

-   You tell the compiler ahead of time what type a variable is going to be.

<code>
bool isNew = 'hello' 
// error
</code>

### Primitive Types

-   6 primitive types
-   **Undefined**: represents lack of existence (you shouldn't set a variable to this)
-   **Null**: represents lack of existence (you can set a variable to this)
-   **Boolean**: true or false
-   **Number**: floating point number (there's always some decimals). Unlike other programming languages, there's only one 'number' type... and it can make math weird.
-   **String**: a sequence of characters (both '' and "" can be used)
-   **Symbol**:

### Operator

-   A special function that is syntactically different
-   Generally, operators take two parameters and return one result

### Namespace

-   A container for variables and functions
-   Typically to keep variables and function with the same name separate
